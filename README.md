MARS ROVER 2.0
=========

Built this neat little HTML-based version of the Mars Rover Bitmaker Labs assignment.

Just for fun, I built it <strong>100% without JavaScript</strong>. User instructions are passed as a form submission to ruby, which dynamically generates the CSS animations that move the rover. Completely pointlessly difficult, but a fun problem to solve.
